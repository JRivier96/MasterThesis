This thesis investigates the potential insurance-like effect of corporate social performance (CSP), represented by a resource use efficiency score, for firms facing commodity price shocks. Previous research has found CSP to offer protection of firm value against negative occurrences, acting as an insurance mechanism. Following these findings, this thesis investigates if companies with more efficient resource management, as a component of CSP, are benefiting from an insurance-like effect when facing commodity price shocks. Furthermore, it examines a potential positive relationship between resource efficiency and stock returns of energy companies. This paper tested these hypotheses with an analysis of the S&P500 firms through an event-study as well as a panel regression model. Findings imply that resource efficiency can act as an insurance mechanism against commodity price shocks among energy companies, while the opposite is observed for the utility and real estate industries. Furthermore, this research finds that stock returns of energy companies is positively correlated with resource management improvements for energy companies under certain conditions. It concludes by presenting the different implications of findings for investors and how these latter can leverage resource efficiency as an investment criterion.
